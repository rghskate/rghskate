## British Ice Skating: Technical Operations Officer

Hi there! I'm the Technical Operations Officer for British Ice Skating. I spend most of my time preparing databases for the adminstration of figure skating competitions, but I also try to develop tools to help make the main part of my job easier.

The only public repo here at time of writing is the one for the small helper program that I created for uploading the websites produced by FS Manager during competitions ([here](https://github.com/rghskate/fsm-web-uploader)). It's definitely a very hacky piece of coding, so if you're inclined, feel free to make pull requests.

I'm also the primary admin of [bisresults.co.uk](https://bisresults.co.uk), so if you have any questions about something you see on there, I'm the first port of call.

Any questions, please direct them to [robert.hayes@iceskating.org.uk](mailto:robert.hayes@iceskating.org.uk).
